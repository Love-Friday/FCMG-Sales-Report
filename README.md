# Sales Analysis

## Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of a FCMG company over the past two years. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, I seek to identify trends, make data- driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance. 

### Data Sources
Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Sales _data.csv" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company. The dataset consists of 910 rows and 8 columns, which include; salesperson, product, region, customer, date,  item price, quantity and revenue. 

### Tools
- MS Excel ( for data cleaning and visualization)

### Data Cleaning/ Preparation
In the cleaning stage, I performed the following tasks;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Removed dupilcates
3. Data cleaning and formatting (changed text case type, removed non- printable characters, formatted date into year and month, calculated revenue, trim columns and others)

   ### Exploratory Data Analysis

   The EDA processes involved me exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as ;

   - What is the overall sales and seasonal trends based on dates?
   -  which salesperson generated the highest sales revenue to the company?
   - What are the top- selling products by quantity and revenue?
   - How does sales revenue vary across different regions?
   - Is there a correlation between price and quantity sold?
   - Who are the top customers in terms of revenue generated?
  
     ### Data Analysis

In this sales analysis project, I utilized various powerful features of MS Excel to delve into the sales data. I leveraged fucctions like clean,text(year, month), trim, proper case,  and Pivot tables to analyze sales variations across different kpi.  Additionally, I used conditional formatting to highlight key insights and trends in the dataset, while the charts and graphs created with Excel helped visualize the sales dynamics effectively. 

 ### Results/ Findings

 The analysis results are summarized as follows;
 1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the festive season.
 2. Vaughn Harlon generated the highest sales over others.
