# Sales Analysis

## Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of a FCMG company over the past two years. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, I seek to identify trends, make data- driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance. 

### Data Sources
Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Sales _data.csv" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company. The dataset consists of 910 rows and 8 columns, which include; salesperson, product, region, customer, date,  item price, quantity and revenue. 

### Tools
- MS Excel ( for data cleaning and visualization)

### Data Cleaning/ Preparation
In the cleaning stage, I performed the following tasks;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Removed dupilcates
3. Data cleaning and formatting (changed text case type, removed non- printable characters, formatted date into year and month, calculated revenue, trim columns and others)

   ### Exploratory Data Analysis

   The EDA processes involved me exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as ;

   - which salesperson generated the highest sales revenue to the company?
   - What are the top- selling products by quantity and revenue?
   - How does sales revenue vary across different regions?
   - Are there any seasonal trends in sales based on dates?
   - Is there a correlation between price and quantity sold?
   - Who are the top customers in terms of revenue generated?
